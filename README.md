### Dedication

Specially this project is dedicated to my parants S.Mujahid hussain (My Father) and Kaneez Fatima Rizvi (My Mother), Institute of Industrial Electronics Engineering: IIEE and to the students of IIEE.

# Building For Hardware Setup

### 1) Proposed Solutuin

Main theme of “SLAM BASED 3D MAP BUILDING USING 2 LOW COST 2D LASER SCANNERS (RPLIDAR A1)” is an orthogonal combination of two RP-Lidar 2D laser scanners which has beed used on slam’s vehicle to build real-time 3D point cloud map of the explored region.
